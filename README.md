# Weather
The programs in this repository are to predict weather on any day of the year based on averages for the past years. Just for those new to large scale data analysis (like myself) here are some key words for a Google search: averages of multiple lists, convert date to 1 through 365, 


The data in the csv file came from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa.org).

If you want to change this file to one that represents the weather in your area, you shouldn't have to change much besides the first for loop. 

The following is only nescessary if you want to use this to produce a lot of graphs. (The program available only produces 1):
Only use Weather.py if you are running this program for the first time, and make sure you have a text file for it to write the averages and fit parameters to. After that, run Weather3.py because it will use the numbers in this text file so that it does not have to calculate them again.
