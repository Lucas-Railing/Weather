# Weather
The programs in this repository are to predict weather on any day of the year based on averages for the past years. Just for those new to large scale data analysis (like myself) here are some key words for a google search: averages of multiple lists, convert date to 1 through 365, 

The data in the csv file came from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa.org).

If you want to change this file to one that represents the weather in your area, you shouldn't have to change much besides the first for loop. 

If you have any questions feel free to email lmrailing@gmail.com.
